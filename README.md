# Samples for Apigee Edge API Services (Google)

This is a collection of sample proxies for the [Apigee Edge API Services](http://apigee.com/about/enterprise), designed to help developers 
learn how to use the platform, including deployment tools to aid in development of proxy bundles.

API Services provides developers with:

* A RESTful API to enable DIY control and oversight of APIs, apps, and developers 

* API Key and OAuth 1 and 2 support

* Out-of-the-box policies for functionality that you would rather not code yourself (like quotas, transformations, response caching, etc.)

* APIs and scripting support for functionality that you would rather innovate and code yourself

* The ability to share your work with other developers, and to reuse it across your own projects, by exposing it as APIs that you own and control

* Scalable, managed test and prod environments with operational analytics

# Getting started

You require an Apigee account. [Sign up for a free trial account.](https://accounts.apigee.com/accounts/sign_up)

You also require [Python](http://python.org/getit/), to use the deployment tool.

# Deploy

You can deploy all of the samples to your organization at once using a simple setup script provided in this distribution.

1. Update the file `/setup/setenv.sh` with settings for your Apigee account.

2. Run `deploy_all.sh`

    **Note**: This step deploys all API products, developers, and apps needed for samples that use OAuth.

Each sample API proxy directory contains a script, `invoke.sh`, that issues a sample HTTP request to the API.

If you make changes to the sample API proxy, simply run the proxy's `deploy.sh` script to redeploy it.

# What's here:

## `/sample-proxies`

A set of fully-functional API proxies that you can deploy and invoke on the Apigee Edge platform.

Feel free to modify and build upon them, and redeploy the proxies for changes to take effect. See the proxy's README for instructions on how to deploy and use it.

For a detailed overview of the available sample see the [API Services Samples documentation](http://apigee.com/docs/enterprise/content/api-platform-samples).

## `/schemas`

XML schemas that you can  use as a reference when working with policies, API proxy configuration,
API products, apps, and developers.


## `/setup`

Simple scripts to help you deploy the sample API proxies and profiles that they 
rely on, including API products, developers, and apps.

Set you Apigee API Platform account settings in `setenv.sh` ([Register for a free Apigee account](http://eneterprise.apigee.com/signup))

To deploy a single sample, run `deploy.sh proxyName`, where `proxyName` is the name of the directory under `/sample-proxies` that contains the proxy you want to deploy.

To deploy all samples and API products, run `deploy_all.sh`

## `/tools`

* `deploy.py`: Uploads an API proxy to an organization on the Apigee Edge API Services platform and then deploys it to the environment specified.

* `proxy_gen.sh`: A simple script that interacts with the API Services platform to locally generate an API proxy scaffold.

* `/org-snapshot`: A configurable tool that retrieves organization settings from the API Services platform by using management server API calls.
